Tickets are $22, $20 concession – book at www.trybooking.com/BNVUO.\n\nStirling Theatre is on Morris Place, Innaloo.",

It is here that Heartland JAPAN positions itself in providing the information and means for inbound visitors to journey off the beaten track.\n\nHeartland JAPAN believes it is important to promote alternative destinations so that travellers become aware of the vast and varied natural, historical and cultural alternatives that are waiting to be discovered across Japan. By opening up these regions, Heartland JAPAN hopes to reignite local economies, reversing the effects of depopulation and urbanisation, and ultimately revitalising these communities.\n\nHeartland JAPAN aims to create life-changing journeys, to provide physical and spiritual fulfillment through outdoor activities, hands-on experiences and cultural exchanges with locals. The company’s current fully guided adventure tours cover five destinations across Japan, all of which are reachable from the various 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics game sites, providing the perfect opportunity for visitors to these events.\n\nHeartland JAPAN regularly holds familiarisation trips and always welcome the media in their pursuit to increase knowledge about and interest in the real Japan.",

        "description": "PERTH, Western Australia (27 July 2021) – acQuire, a global software company specialising in geoscientific information management, has launched GIM Suite 5, a major advance to their flagship product. The new release includes a raft of brand-new features plus a transition to a new licence model.\n\nGIM Suite 5 has been built for the future of data management, with the aim to improve the way geologists and miners manage their geological data. The new release streamlines data collection from the field to sample submission and provides a way to seamlessly manage their entire field data collection workflow across mobile, desktop and web.\n\nNew: Drillhole logging and sampling in web and mobile\nSteve Mundell, Director of Product at acQuire, says the company is focused on continually evolving the GIM Suite software to ensure miners are always working with the most powerful geological data management tools on the market.\n\n“We’ve focused on providing dynamic and interactive tools for geologists to match the way they work,” Steve said.\n\n“GIM Suite 5’s new interface is designed for drillhole logging and sampling across a range of drilling methods, from exploration to production, whether you’re collecting data in remote field locations or logging in the core shed.\n\n“It gives you visual feedback in real time when logging geological observations and sample intervals within a graphical log in web or mobile.\n\n“You no longer need to use multiple software tools for different logging scenarios.”\n\nGeologists working with geoscientific data can use GIM Suite 5 for Reverse Circulation (RC), air rotary drilling or Rotary Air Blast (RAB), air core (AC) or diamond drilling methods.\n\nWorkers in a remote environment with limited or no connectivity, can capture drillhole data using the acQuire Arena mobile app. Alternatively, if they’re working online, they can easily capture data on any Windows device through a web browser.\n\nNew: Streamlined data collection from the field to sample submission\nGIM Suite 5 smoothly integrates all the steps from mobile data capture in the field to creating sample despatch reports on the web. Users can plan, capture, import, monitor and despatch.\n\n “This results in a fast, efficient, and accurate way to manage geological data across an entire field collection workflow,” Steve explained.\n\nNew: Rapidly create complex data queries\nA new web-based tool, called Data Discovery, enables senior geologists or anyone on a geology team to discover and access all data stored in GIM Suite.\n\n“We want to give miners a way to dig deeper into their geological data, when they need to” Steve said.\n\n“You can rapidly construct complex queries in our web interface. The data discovery tool lets you create complex data queries and views with a ‘drag and drop’ tool.\n\n“You can construct queries, filter or aggregate data across data views, and create on the fly calculations.”\n\nNew: Data definition library to improve data integrity\nBusiness rules and other parameters governing the quality and integrity of geological data are controlled from a central location in a new, web-based data definition library. This simplifies how data definitions are managed and allows you to apply business rules consistently across all methods of data capture. Configuration times for new projects are reduced because you can rely on your previously created data definitions.\n\nNew: Cloud-based licensing solution\nacQuire has overhauled the way they licence their technology to ensure everyone who needs GIM Suite has easier access to the product.\n\n“We’re introducing a simplified and more flexible licence model for all users of GIM Suite technology with this release,” Steve said.\n\n“GIM Suite licences are now managed from a cloud-based licence platform, making it easier to access and manage team licences.”",

        "description": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut–brain interaction worldwide, estimated to affect around 15% of the global population. With symptoms leading to a decreased quality of life along with high medical costs, IBS is a significant health care burden. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for IBS sufferers. New research published reveals that app-delivered gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) is proving highly successful at helping people manage their IBS symptoms. The research found that 64% of sufferers reported a reduction in symptoms after using the mobile app-delivered GDH program; similar rates to that seen in in-person studies. Access to GDH has traditionally been limited because of the high costs associated with face-to-face therapies, further compounded by a shortage of qualified therapists. A mobile app delivering GDH in a convenient and cost-effective way offers a solution to address the gaps in GDH accessibility. The latest research shows that mobile app-delivered GDH, through the Nerva program, helped participants to significantly reduce overall and specific symptoms of IBS, similar to rates seen in face-to-face trials. Accessible via an easy-to-use app, Nerva helps patients learn to self-manage their IBS symptoms with 20-minute daily hypnotherapy sessions, breathing exercises, and educational readings. The Nerva program is broken into two phases; the first being a 6-week course focused on helping patients gain control over their symptoms, followed by a support program focused on helping patients keep their symptoms under control. The program is suitable for people suffering from a range of IBS-related symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea. ",

So, what if you could just pop a couple of capsules a day and all those nasty symptoms would go away, without any side effects. Well, a New Zealand based manufacturer, Regenex Laboratories, claim to have formulated the magic pills you seek. So how did they come up with this magic pill?  Well it seems a study of over 3,204 menopausal women has revealed the missing dietary vitamins and minerals that deplete from the body and lead to the symptoms of menopause, including the night sweats, the mood changes, the ability to sleep and hot flashes, and it seems there are 12 common elements missing. The 3 amino acids, known as L-Lysine, L-Arginine and L-Carnitine are always lacking, along with the thyroid balancing element of Iodine and B group vitamins. There are also common elements, such as Magnesium, Selenium and Zinc, that everyone becomes deficient in with age. Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural part of a woman’s evolution, but most pharmaceutical companies, and some media outlets, would have you believe you are suffering an incurable disease. Spokesperson for Regenex Laboratories, Angela Sy, says “we are not attempting to cure Menopause, as Menopause is a natural part of a womans life cycle, but we are looking to relieve all the symptoms that are associated with this critical period of change, and make life as comfortable and as normal as possible.” ",

It provided a turning point where distinctly Australian life and characters were openly and authentically portrayed, signalling the maturity of a nation prepared to question its stereotypes and attitudes. The story follows two itinerant cane cutters, Barney and Roo, who have spent the past 16 summers in the off-season with two barmaids in Melbourne. Every year, Roo has brought a tinsel doll to his girl Olive, as a gift to symbolise their relationship – but this 17th summer is somehow different. Originally performing as a teenager, Tim has returned to the stage in recent years, appearing in Jesus Christ Superstar and an end-of-year pantomime with the Albany Light Opera and Theatre Company and The Phantom of the Opera, Pride and Prejudice, Anything Goes, Speaking in Tongues and The Darling Buds of May with Limelight Theatre. He has also performed in You Can’t Have One at Stirling Theatre and directed David Williamson’s Let The Sunshine at Limelight Theatre in 2017. ",

        "description": "THEY say the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach – but a wickedly black comedy from Much Productions is giving the phrase an entirely new meaning. Written by Debbie Isitt and directed by Jane Sherwood at Eaton’s Little Theatre, The Woman Who Cooked Her Husband is a spicy tale about a love triangle served with a generous helping of acerbic wit. Kenneth finds himself in the arms of Laura after 20 years of marriage to the culinary-talented Hilary. But he soon discovers his new love can’t cook and mourns the loss of Sunday roasts, haute cuisine and the comforts of a settled life. Involved with the Perth theatre scene since 2005, Jane was a founding member of Phoenix Theatre and has been involved with the Old Mill, Stirling, Black Swan, Rag and Bone, Kwinana and Harbour Theatres, A lad in sane productions, ARENAarts and Fringe World. She has won numerous accolades at the annual Finley Awards, Dramafest, South West Drama Festival and Hills Festival of Theatre including best director and best production. After directing an acclaimed version of To Kill A Mockingbird earlier this year, Jane then established Much Productions to stage The Woman Who Cooked Her Husband. ",

        "description": "In the middle of this incessant pandemic, where many businesses are closing down, a glimmer of something new emerging is music to our ears! The Wildwood Instruments Art Gallery is a small, independent gallery in regional Victoria that is about to open its doors to the public. Nick Carpenter is a luthier and artist, and has created a very inviting gallery space, dedicated to the theme of music. He creates stunning 3D artworks that draw on the grit and glitz (and everything in between) of our musical culture. Nick’s workshop, where he runs his guitar making courses, and the new art gallery, are located in Mount Franklin, a (Rolling) stones throw from Daylesford. The gallery will kick off with Nick’s latest exhibition, Music Is My Muse, on the 30 October 2021, Melbourne Cup long weekend. It will be open Saturdays and Sundays 10am to 4pm. The exhibition will run until the end of November, after which the gallery will continue to open on weekends, with a changing array of Nick’s works on display. Drop in and have a chat with the artist and see some ‘notable’ art. There is a viewing window into the workshop where you may even catch a guitar-making course in progress. ",

Here Comes The Sun is a visual art show depicting the pair’s unique interpretations of The Beatles’ 1969 classic. collaboration came to be after Nella – Sue’s lifelong friend since they attended Our Lady of The Manger school at age 9 – snapped up a limited edition framed print of Sue’s when she saw it on Facebook. Sue, a professional sports, birth and lifestyle photographer had produced a commemorative piece of the night sky on Saturday 28 March 2020, the date originally scheduled for Showdown 48, postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The Showdown That Never Was' is one of eleven large pieces to be displayed at Martini On The Parade during August. The exhibition includes one signature, collaborative piece. Those unable to attend in person can view the pieces online via the exhibition website. Nella and Sue’s connection extends beyond schooling and their penchant for visual expression. Both of Italian parents and with a love of Beatles music, their home studios with views of the ocean draw in the afternoon sunshine and inspire their work, as expressed in the accompanying ‘teaser’ video. The full video will premiere at the invitation only opening night of their SALA exhibition on 30 July. Nikon Australia and notable Adelaide businesses including Serafino Wines and Class A Jewellers are exhibition sponsors. Sue’s works will be featured in Nikon’s Behind The Lens series on 3 August. ",

        "description": "SHAKESPEARE’S long-lost first play, written when he was 17, is coming to Melville Theatre after being found in a treasure-filled English parking lot. The literary holy grail features Shakespeare’s most famous characters and familiar speeches in a new story. But at 100 hours with multiple unwieldy storylines, it was decided by writers Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor to abridge it – as a public service – to a brief and palatable 90-minute performance. Vanessa Jensen is directing William Shakespeare's Long Lost First Play (abridged), a fast, funny and fictional 40th play by the Bard that weaves together his popular speeches and plot devices. The main challenge, according to Vanessa, is reassuring non-Shakespeare fans that they don’t need to know or like his work to enjoy the show. “We also don’t want to offend true Shakespeare aficionados with the way the great Bard’s work is twisted and turned inside out for the sake of humour,” she said. First appearing on stage as an eight-year-old and directing her first show at 14, Vanessa has a wealth of theatre experience behind her. She wrote, directed, stage-managed and acted in various shows at Curtin University’s Hayman Theatre over a four-year period and has staged a plethora of successful productions at the Old Mill and Melville Theatres. Vanessa has plenty of best director and best play awards and nominations to her credit for shows including Away, Jamie’s Chooks, Twelve Angry Men, Mr Bailey’s Minder, Amadeus, Rabbit Hole and Love, Loss and What I Wore.
