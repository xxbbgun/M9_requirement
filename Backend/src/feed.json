        "description": "AN AUSTRALIAN stage classic written by playwright Ray Lawler – who turned 100 this year – is coming to Stirling Theatre.\n\nDirected by Tim Riessen, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is considered by literary scholars to be the most significant play in Australian theatre history.\n\nIt provided a turning point where distinctly Australian life and characters were openly and authentically portrayed, signalling the maturity of a nation prepared to question its stereotypes and attitudes.\n\nThe story follows two itinerant cane cutters, Barney and Roo, who have spent the past 16 summers in the off-season with two barmaids in Melbourne.\n\nEvery year, Roo has brought a tinsel doll to his girl Olive, as a gift to symbolise their relationship – but this 17th summer is somehow different.\n\n“Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is an iconic Australian play that highlights the unravelling of lives,” Tim said.\n\n“It’s about the end of an era for the characters.\n\n“One of the challenges is bringing to life the type of lifestyle portrayed, so younger audiences can gain an understanding of it.\n\n“For the era, the idea of unmarried folk would have been quite controversial – this is less so today, so getting this across will be important.”\n\nOriginally performing as a teenager, Tim has returned to the stage in recent years, appearing in Jesus Christ Superstar and an end-of-year pantomime with the Albany Light Opera and Theatre Company and The Phantom of the Opera, Pride and Prejudice, Anything Goes, Speaking in Tongues and The Darling Buds of May with Limelight Theatre.\n\nHe has also performed in You Can’t Have One at Stirling Theatre and directed David Williamson’s Let The Sunshine at Limelight Theatre in 2017.\n\n“Summer of the Seventeenth Doll appealed because it embodies the emergence of the Aussie spirit,” Tim said.\n\n“It speaks to me of my parents and grandparents.”\n\nSummer of the Seventeenth Doll plays at 8pm November 26, 27, December 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11 with 2pm matinees November 28 and December 5. Tickets are $22, $20 concession – book at www.trybooking.com/BNVUO.\n\nStirling Theatre is on Morris Place, Innaloo.",

Whether it be helping farmers build new fences or providing food and clothing to those that have lost everything, the money raised will be crucial in helping families get back on their feet as soon as possible.",

        "description": "TOKYO, 17 October 2018 -- Tokyo based startup tour operator Heartland JAPAN is leading the way in creating sustainable travel destinations off the so-called Golden Route (Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima etc.) which is currently overburdened by the year on year increase in inbound travellers (an increase of 450% over the past  five years), set to reach 40M in 2020.\n\nIn spite of the staggering rise in foreign tourists, relatively little has been done so far to make travellers aware of alternative destinations, with a continued fixation on commercialised travel spots. It is here that Heartland JAPAN positions itself in providing the information and means for inbound visitors to journey off the beaten track.\n\nHeartland JAPAN believes it is important to promote alternative destinations so that travellers become aware of the vast and varied natural, historical and cultural alternatives that are waiting to be discovered across Japan. By opening up these regions, Heartland JAPAN hopes to reignite local economies, reversing the effects of depopulation and urbanisation, and ultimately revitalising these communities.\n\nHeartland JAPAN aims to create life-changing journeys, to provide physical and spiritual fulfillment through outdoor activities, hands-on experiences and cultural exchanges with locals. The company’s current fully guided adventure tours cover five destinations across Japan, all of which are reachable from the various 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics game sites, providing the perfect opportunity for visitors to these events.\n\nHeartland JAPAN regularly holds familiarisation trips and always welcome the media in their pursuit to increase knowledge about and interest in the real Japan.",
