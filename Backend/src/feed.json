St John will continue to provide state of the art outpatient ophthalmic facilities to Queensland's most vulnerable communities, and to other regions across Australia. Lyndall De Marco, The IDEAS Van founding CEO, said, “The last eight years have been spent refining operations of our mobile outpatient facility, the first of its kind in Australia. It has been an extraordinary journey, with over 7,000 patients treated, mostly complex cases receiving their specialist services by our world-class ophthalmologists, completely bulk-billed to Medicare with 'no out of pocket expenses'. Patients have been treated in Victorian and Queensland communities, close to home and in collaboration with Emerald and Gladstone Hospitals which have utilised The IDEAS Van to conduct their ophthalmic outpatients’ clinics since 2019. Stephen Porter, CEO St John Queensland, said, “We are delighted for the opportunity to build on the success of The IDEAS Van which has developed an extraordinary partnership with the medical, corporate and public sectors. St John Ambulance is dedicated to enhancing the lives of all those in regional areas, with a renewed focus on resilience, wellbeing and community. This outstanding facility will make it possible for more ophthalmologists to bring their expertise to people that are marginalised due to the tyranny of distance and access. It will enable Australia’s most vulnerable communities to address the issue of avoidable blindness.” ",

        "description": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut–brain interaction worldwide, estimated to affect around 15% of the global population. With symptoms leading to a decreased quality of life along with high medical costs, IBS is a significant health care burden. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for IBS sufferers. New research published reveals that app-delivered gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) is proving highly successful at helping people manage their IBS symptoms. The research found that 64% of sufferers reported a reduction in symptoms after using the mobile app-delivered GDH program; similar rates to that seen in in-person studies. Access to GDH has traditionally been limited because of the high costs associated with face-to-face therapies, further compounded by a shortage of qualified therapists. A mobile app delivering GDH in a convenient and cost-effective way offers a solution to address the gaps in GDH accessibility. The latest research shows that mobile app-delivered GDH, through the Nerva program, helped participants to significantly reduce overall and specific symptoms of IBS, similar to rates seen in face-to-face trials. Accessible via an easy-to-use app, Nerva helps patients learn to self-manage their IBS symptoms with 20-minute daily hypnotherapy sessions, breathing exercises, and educational readings. The Nerva program is broken into two phases; the first being a 6-week course focused on helping patients gain control over their symptoms, followed by a support program focused on helping patients keep their symptoms under control. The program is suitable for people suffering from a range of IBS-related symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea. ",

Migrating from her home in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the catastrophic 2010 earthquakes, Vidhu decided to make a new start in Western Australia. A decade later, Vidhu was awarded the title Business Migrant of the Year 2020 at the recent 27th Belmont & Western Australian Small Business Awards and is a finalist in the 2021 Swan Chamber of Commerce Business Awards. Ayurveda, meaning the science of life, traces its history back 5,000 years to the Indus Valley in modern-day India. Widely regarded as the oldest form of healthcare in the world, it includes a number of disciplines including diet, lifestyle changes, herbal medicine, yoga, massage techniques and meditation. Vidhu is also a finalist for Business Woman of the Year and Community Services Excellence Award at The India Australia Business & Community Awards in Sydney in May 2021. She also has the title of City of Swan Community Citizen of the Year Award 2020 as one of her growing lists of accolades. Vidhu explains, ‘The central philosophy is that complete physical health cannot be achieved without restoration of emotional, mental and spiritual health, and body, mind and soul have to be taken care of in an individual. ‘Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many people have struggled in some way with their health or with mental health challenges, Ayurveda has a lot to offer.’ Vidhu says she has dedicated herself to promoting good will and harmonious relations between the Indian culture and heritage with the wider community in Australia. Apart from leading several community projects, Vidhu has contributed to the community by promoting education and continuing to raise awareness about positive mental health and advancement of health and wellbeing.

So, what if you could just pop a couple of capsules a day and all those nasty symptoms would go away, without any side effects. Well, a New Zealand based manufacturer, Regenex Laboratories, claim to have formulated the magic pills you seek. So how did they come up with this magic pill?  Well it seems a study of over 3,204 menopausal women has revealed the missing dietary vitamins and minerals that deplete from the body and lead to the symptoms of menopause, including the night sweats, the mood changes, the ability to sleep and hot flashes, and it seems there are 12 common elements missing. The 3 amino acids, known as L-Lysine, L-Arginine and L-Carnitine are always lacking, along with the thyroid balancing element of Iodine and B group vitamins. There are also common elements, such as Magnesium, Selenium and Zinc, that everyone becomes deficient in with age. Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural part of a woman’s evolution, but most pharmaceutical companies, and some media outlets, would have you believe you are suffering an incurable disease. Spokesperson for Regenex Laboratories, Angela Sy, says “we are not attempting to cure Menopause, as Menopause is a natural part of a womans life cycle, but we are looking to relieve all the symptoms that are associated with this critical period of change, and make life as comfortable and as normal as possible.” ",

Directed by Tim Riessen, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is considered by literary scholars to be the most significant play in Australian theatre history. It provided a turning point where distinctly Australian life and characters were openly and authentically portrayed, signalling the maturity of a nation prepared to question its stereotypes and attitudes. The story follows two itinerant cane cutters, Barney and Roo, who have spent the past 16 summers in the off-season with two barmaids in Melbourne. Every year, Roo has brought a tinsel doll to his girl Olive, as a gift to symbolise their relationship – but this 17th summer is somehow different. Originally performing as a teenager, Tim has returned to the stage in recent years, appearing in Jesus Christ Superstar and an end-of-year pantomime with the Albany Light Opera and Theatre Company and The Phantom of the Opera, Pride and Prejudice, Anything Goes, Speaking in Tongues and The Darling Buds of May with Limelight Theatre. He has also performed in You Can’t Have One at Stirling Theatre and directed David Williamson’s Let The Sunshine at Limelight Theatre in 2017. ",

Kenneth finds himself in the arms of Laura after 20 years of marriage to the culinary-talented Hilary.

        "description": "SHAKESPEARE’S long-lost first play, written when he was 17, is coming to Melville Theatre after being found in a treasure-filled English parking lot. The literary holy grail features Shakespeare’s most famous characters and familiar speeches in a new story. But at 100 hours with multiple unwieldy storylines, it was decided by writers Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor to abridge it – as a public service – to a brief and palatable 90-minute performance. Vanessa Jensen is directing William Shakespeare's Long Lost First Play (abridged), a fast, funny and fictional 40th play by the Bard that weaves together his popular speeches and plot devices. The main challenge, according to Vanessa, is reassuring non-Shakespeare fans that they don’t need to know or like his work to enjoy the show. “We also don’t want to offend true Shakespeare aficionados with the way the great Bard’s work is twisted and turned inside out for the sake of humour,” she said. First appearing on stage as an eight-year-old and directing her first show at 14, Vanessa has a wealth of theatre experience behind her. She wrote, directed, stage-managed and acted in various shows at Curtin University’s Hayman Theatre over a four-year period and has staged a plethora of successful productions at the Old Mill and Melville Theatres. Vanessa has plenty of best director and best play awards and nominations to her credit for shows including Away, Jamie’s Chooks, Twelve Angry Men, Mr Bailey’s Minder, Amadeus, Rabbit Hole and Love, Loss and What I Wore.
