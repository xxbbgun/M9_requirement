Tickets are $22, $20 concession – book at www.trybooking.com/BNVUO.\n\nStirling Theatre is on Morris Place, Innaloo.",

It is here that Heartland JAPAN positions itself in providing the information and means for inbound visitors to journey off the beaten track.\n\nHeartland JAPAN believes it is important to promote alternative destinations so that travellers become aware of the vast and varied natural, historical and cultural alternatives that are waiting to be discovered across Japan. By opening up these regions, Heartland JAPAN hopes to reignite local economies, reversing the effects of depopulation and urbanisation, and ultimately revitalising these communities.\n\nHeartland JAPAN aims to create life-changing journeys, to provide physical and spiritual fulfillment through outdoor activities, hands-on experiences and cultural exchanges with locals. The company’s current fully guided adventure tours cover five destinations across Japan, all of which are reachable from the various 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics game sites, providing the perfect opportunity for visitors to these events.\n\nHeartland JAPAN regularly holds familiarisation trips and always welcome the media in their pursuit to increase knowledge about and interest in the real Japan.",

        "description": "PERTH, Western Australia (27 July 2021) – acQuire, a global software company specialising in geoscientific information management, has launched GIM Suite 5, a major advance to their flagship product. The new release includes a raft of brand-new features plus a transition to a new licence model.\n\nGIM Suite 5 has been built for the future of data management, with the aim to improve the way geologists and miners manage their geological data. The new release streamlines data collection from the field to sample submission and provides a way to seamlessly manage their entire field data collection workflow across mobile, desktop and web.\n\nNew: Drillhole logging and sampling in web and mobile\nSteve Mundell, Director of Product at acQuire, says the company is focused on continually evolving the GIM Suite software to ensure miners are always working with the most powerful geological data management tools on the market.\n\n“We’ve focused on providing dynamic and interactive tools for geologists to match the way they work,” Steve said.\n\n“GIM Suite 5’s new interface is designed for drillhole logging and sampling across a range of drilling methods, from exploration to production, whether you’re collecting data in remote field locations or logging in the core shed.\n\n“It gives you visual feedback in real time when logging geological observations and sample intervals within a graphical log in web or mobile.\n\n“You no longer need to use multiple software tools for different logging scenarios.”\n\nGeologists working with geoscientific data can use GIM Suite 5 for Reverse Circulation (RC), air rotary drilling or Rotary Air Blast (RAB), air core (AC) or diamond drilling methods.\n\nWorkers in a remote environment with limited or no connectivity, can capture drillhole data using the acQuire Arena mobile app. Alternatively, if they’re working online, they can easily capture data on any Windows device through a web browser.\n\nNew: Streamlined data collection from the field to sample submission\nGIM Suite 5 smoothly integrates all the steps from mobile data capture in the field to creating sample despatch reports on the web. Users can plan, capture, import, monitor and despatch.\n\n “This results in a fast, efficient, and accurate way to manage geological data across an entire field collection workflow,” Steve explained.\n\nNew: Rapidly create complex data queries\nA new web-based tool, called Data Discovery, enables senior geologists or anyone on a geology team to discover and access all data stored in GIM Suite.\n\n“We want to give miners a way to dig deeper into their geological data, when they need to” Steve said.\n\n“You can rapidly construct complex queries in our web interface. The data discovery tool lets you create complex data queries and views with a ‘drag and drop’ tool.\n\n“You can construct queries, filter or aggregate data across data views, and create on the fly calculations.”\n\nNew: Data definition library to improve data integrity\nBusiness rules and other parameters governing the quality and integrity of geological data are controlled from a central location in a new, web-based data definition library. This simplifies how data definitions are managed and allows you to apply business rules consistently across all methods of data capture. Configuration times for new projects are reduced because you can rely on your previously created data definitions.\n\nNew: Cloud-based licensing solution\nacQuire has overhauled the way they licence their technology to ensure everyone who needs GIM Suite has easier access to the product.\n\n“We’re introducing a simplified and more flexible licence model for all users of GIM Suite technology with this release,” Steve said.\n\n“GIM Suite licences are now managed from a cloud-based licence platform, making it easier to access and manage team licences.”",
