        "description": "Heather Blackstock enjoyed a country upbringing on a mixed farming property at 'Hucclecote,' Dorrigo. N.S.W. After leaving school, her first 20 years of employment consisted of a variety of clerical duties. Then Heather became self-employed as a full time and competitive, and successful artist. Some of Heathers meritorious achievements include an Associate Diploma of Creative Arts at the Riverina College of Advanced Education and a Bachelor of Arts in Creative Arts at Griffith University (Gold Coast). Heather has artworks held in City Collections and private collections in Australia and overseas. Since losing her husband in 1999, Heather has travelled extensively and become a Marriage Celebrant and a Justice of the Peace. In November 2006, Heather was awarded a Fellowship with the Royal Queensland Art Society(Gold Coast). Heathers most successful achievement has been her illustrations for 'The Australian Book of Nursery Rhyme'. Heather was asked in 2008 by Ruth Holmes, who is a member of the Dorrigo Historical Society if she would write a memoir for her father George Winkley, and she did. 'Dawn Till Dusk' then followed. Heather's work is represented in five self-published books with a writing Group, 'Eloquence Coterie'. In addition, Heather has recently published an illustrated poetry book, 'Passages From Life' and 'Short Stories, Not All Lies' with Angel Key Publications P/L. The contribution of 'Short Stories, Not All Lies' was inspired by natural human nature factors, crossing borders of beliefs and offering poignant truths and nuances from a diversity of life. They include adventurous travel, unusual events, love lost and found. In sharing unforgettable memories, they give insight into our forever changing times and values. All book titles are visible online and can be purchased online through various outlets. ",

        "description": "Girl Guides SA Inc is an organisation empowering girls and young women to grow into confident, self-respecting, responsible community members through Girl-Led, non-academic programs and activities. The Australian Guiding Program provides opportunities for girls to be the best that can be and harness their individual potential to make a difference. We foster personal characteristics based on our values of respect and collaboration to engender leadership qualities.  Our organisation is inclusive and as such has members from diverse cultural backgrounds and all level of physical, intellectual and emotional abilities. We seek to ensure that we can provide programs and activities that children with special needs, disadvantaged backgrounds and or disabilities can participate in and enjoy. State Camp is the major coming event for Girl Guides SA Inc. The camp is held every 3 years so that the girls will have the opportunities to experience differing activities, sites and facilities throughout their Guiding life. It is the major state event where Guides, Leaders and other Volunteers come together and experience the wonder of being out in the great outdoors. Learning new skills, have adventurous experiences, making lifelong friendships and recognising the richness of human and environmental diversity in its many forms. It’s an opportunity for girls and women from all walks of life, identities and lived experiences to have a sense of belonging and can participate fully in various activities. The 2021 Riverdaze State Camp will be held from the 4-8 October, 2021, at Camp Kedron, Barmera, situated on the shores of one of the Riverland’s most scenic lakes, Lake Bonney. Barmera is often described as the jewel of the Riverland with its rich grassy banks and vibrant wetlands, the scenic town will provide Guides with a fantastic opportunity to enjoy aquatic adventures, the Tacker Attack Kids Mud Obstacle Course, Smores by the campfire and so much more. The camp will be full of fun, learning, development and making new friends from around the state. Girl Guides South Australia is very excited to be able to support and provide a camp in these difficult times. Although our Broken Hill Guides are unable to attend, we will still have a large contingent of South Australian Guides attending from all round the state. Girl Guides are showing how they can overcome challenges and participate in outdoor activities that are inclusive and provide girls with opportunities to be themselves, even in these unprecedented times!",

        "description": "Australian charity, Rotary Australia World Community Service, today announced the creation of a national Flood Relief Appeal for people impacted by the recent floods up and down the Eastern seaboard. Australians impacted by the recent floods will be the beneficiaries of money raised by Flood Appeal and will be able to liaise with their local Rotary Club to advise of their needs. The fundraising campaign, which aims to raise in excess of $10 million, was launched this week to support the communities in need after yet another disaster impacting Australians. “The money raised from the Appeal will go directly and quickly to support those impacted, providing essential items and financial support where Disaster relief and Insurance claims won’t stretch,” said Rotary Australia World Community Service Ltd CEO Andrew Woodward. “The number of disasters Australians have endured in the last two years have been significant and left a lot of people in very difficult financial positions,” Mr Woodward said. Rotary Australia World Community Service has previously raised money for Bushfire and Drought affected areas and sees this disaster as just another where the network of Rotarians can step in to assist. Mr Woodward said that he expects the money to help people with the things that insurance or disaster relief funds cannot replace. Whether it be helping farmers build new fences or providing food and clothing to those that have lost everything, the money raised will be crucial in helping families get back on their feet as soon as possible.",

        "description": "TOKYO, 17 October 2018 -- Tokyo based startup tour operator Heartland JAPAN is leading the way in creating sustainable travel destinations off the so-called Golden Route (Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima etc.) which is currently overburdened by the year on year increase in inbound travellers (an increase of 450% over the past  five years), set to reach 40M in 2020. In spite of the staggering rise in foreign tourists, relatively little has been done so far to make travellers aware of alternative destinations, with a continued fixation on commercialised travel spots. It is here that Heartland JAPAN positions itself in providing the information and means for inbound visitors to journey off the beaten track. Heartland JAPAN believes it is important to promote alternative destinations so that travellers become aware of the vast and varied natural, historical and cultural alternatives that are waiting to be discovered across Japan. By opening up these regions, Heartland JAPAN hopes to reignite local economies, reversing the effects of depopulation and urbanisation, and ultimately revitalising these communities. Heartland JAPAN aims to create life-changing journeys, to provide physical and spiritual fulfillment through outdoor activities, hands-on experiences and cultural exchanges with locals. The company’s current fully guided adventure tours cover five destinations across Japan, all of which are reachable from the various 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics game sites, providing the perfect opportunity for visitors to these events. Heartland JAPAN regularly holds familiarisation trips and always welcome the media in their pursuit to increase knowledge about and interest in the real Japan.",

St John will continue to provide state of the art outpatient ophthalmic facilities to Queensland's most vulnerable communities, and to other regions across Australia. Lyndall De Marco, The IDEAS Van founding CEO, said, “The last eight years have been spent refining operations of our mobile outpatient facility, the first of its kind in Australia. It has been an extraordinary journey, with over 7,000 patients treated, mostly complex cases receiving their specialist services by our world-class ophthalmologists, completely bulk-billed to Medicare with 'no out of pocket expenses'. Patients have been treated in Victorian and Queensland communities, close to home and in collaboration with Emerald and Gladstone Hospitals which have utilised The IDEAS Van to conduct their ophthalmic outpatients’ clinics since 2019. Stephen Porter, CEO St John Queensland, said, “We are delighted for the opportunity to build on the success of The IDEAS Van which has developed an extraordinary partnership with the medical, corporate and public sectors. St John Ambulance is dedicated to enhancing the lives of all those in regional areas, with a renewed focus on resilience, wellbeing and community. This outstanding facility will make it possible for more ophthalmologists to bring their expertise to people that are marginalised due to the tyranny of distance and access.

        "description": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut–brain interaction worldwide, estimated to affect around 15% of the global population. With symptoms leading to a decreased quality of life along with high medical costs, IBS is a significant health care burden. However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for IBS sufferers. New research published reveals that app-delivered gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) is proving highly successful at helping people manage their IBS symptoms. The research found that 64% of sufferers reported a reduction in symptoms after using the mobile app-delivered GDH program; similar rates to that seen in in-person studies. Access to GDH has traditionally been limited because of the high costs associated with face-to-face therapies, further compounded by a shortage of qualified therapists. A mobile app delivering GDH in a convenient and cost-effective way offers a solution to address the gaps in GDH accessibility. The latest research shows that mobile app-delivered GDH, through the Nerva program, helped participants to significantly reduce overall and specific symptoms of IBS, similar to rates seen in face-to-face trials. Accessible via an easy-to-use app, Nerva helps patients learn to self-manage their IBS symptoms with 20-minute daily hypnotherapy sessions, breathing exercises, and educational readings. The Nerva program is broken into two phases; the first being a 6-week course focused on helping patients gain control over their symptoms, followed by a support program focused on helping patients keep their symptoms under control. The program is suitable for people suffering from a range of IBS-related symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea. ",

Migrating from her home in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the catastrophic 2010 earthquakes, Vidhu decided to make a new start in Western Australia. A decade later, Vidhu was awarded the title Business Migrant of the Year 2020 at the recent 27th Belmont & Western Australian Small Business Awards and is a finalist in the 2021 Swan Chamber of Commerce Business Awards. Ayurveda, meaning the science of life, traces its history back 5,000 years to the Indus Valley in modern-day India. Widely regarded as the oldest form of healthcare in the world, it includes a number of disciplines including diet, lifestyle changes, herbal medicine, yoga, massage techniques and meditation. Vidhu is also a finalist for Business Woman of the Year and Community Services Excellence Award at The India Australia Business & Community Awards in Sydney in May 2021. She also has the title of City of Swan Community Citizen of the Year Award 2020 as one of her growing lists of accolades. Vidhu explains, ‘The central philosophy is that complete physical health cannot be achieved without restoration of emotional, mental and spiritual health, and body, mind and soul have to be taken care of in an individual. ‘Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many people have struggled in some way with their health or with mental health challenges, Ayurveda has a lot to offer.’ Vidhu says she has dedicated herself to promoting good will and harmonious relations between the Indian culture and heritage with the wider community in Australia. Apart from leading several community projects, Vidhu has contributed to the community by promoting education and continuing to raise awareness about positive mental health and advancement of health and wellbeing.

So, what if you could just pop a couple of capsules a day and all those nasty symptoms would go away, without any side effects. Well, a New Zealand based manufacturer, Regenex Laboratories, claim to have formulated the magic pills you seek. So how did they come up with this magic pill?  Well it seems a study of over 3,204 menopausal women has revealed the missing dietary vitamins and minerals that deplete from the body and lead to the symptoms of menopause, including the night sweats, the mood changes, the ability to sleep and hot flashes, and it seems there are 12 common elements missing. The 3 amino acids, known as L-Lysine, L-Arginine and L-Carnitine are always lacking, along with the thyroid balancing element of Iodine and B group vitamins. There are also common elements, such as Magnesium, Selenium and Zinc, that everyone becomes deficient in with age. Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural part of a woman’s evolution, but most pharmaceutical companies, and some media outlets, would have you believe you are suffering an incurable disease. Spokesperson for Regenex Laboratories, Angela Sy, says “we are not attempting to cure Menopause, as Menopause is a natural part of a womans life cycle, but we are looking to relieve all the symptoms that are associated with this critical period of change, and make life as comfortable and as normal as possible.” ",

Directed by Tim Riessen, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is considered by literary scholars to be the most significant play in Australian theatre history. It provided a turning point where distinctly Australian life and characters were openly and authentically portrayed, signalling the maturity of a nation prepared to question its stereotypes and attitudes. The story follows two itinerant cane cutters, Barney and Roo, who have spent the past 16 summers in the off-season with two barmaids in Melbourne. Every year, Roo has brought a tinsel doll to his girl Olive, as a gift to symbolise their relationship – but this 17th summer is somehow different. Originally performing as a teenager, Tim has returned to the stage in recent years, appearing in Jesus Christ Superstar and an end-of-year pantomime with the Albany Light Opera and Theatre Company and The Phantom of the Opera, Pride and Prejudice, Anything Goes, Speaking in Tongues and The Darling Buds of May with Limelight Theatre.

        "description": "While Adelaide is in the grips of winter, artist Nella De Pizzol and photographer Sue McKay are immersed in sunshine creating works for their inaugural exhibition as part of the 2021 SALA Festival. Here Comes The Sun is a visual art show depicting the pair’s unique interpretations of The Beatles’ 1969 classic. collaboration came to be after Nella – Sue’s lifelong friend since they attended Our Lady of The Manger school at age 9 – snapped up a limited edition framed print of Sue’s when she saw it on Facebook. Sue, a professional sports, birth and lifestyle photographer had produced a commemorative piece of the night sky on Saturday 28 March 2020, the date originally scheduled for Showdown 48, postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The Showdown That Never Was' is one of eleven large pieces to be displayed at Martini On The Parade during August. The exhibition includes one signature, collaborative piece. Those unable to attend in person can view the pieces online via the exhibition website. Nella and Sue’s connection extends beyond schooling and their penchant for visual expression. Both of Italian parents and with a love of Beatles music, their home studios with views of the ocean draw in the afternoon sunshine and inspire their work, as expressed in the accompanying ‘teaser’ video. The full video will premiere at the invitation only opening night of their SALA exhibition on 30 July. Nikon Australia and notable Adelaide businesses including Serafino Wines and Class A Jewellers are exhibition sponsors. Sue’s works will be featured in Nikon’s Behind The Lens series on 3 August. ",

        "description": "SHAKESPEARE’S long-lost first play, written when he was 17, is coming to Melville Theatre after being found in a treasure-filled English parking lot. The literary holy grail features Shakespeare’s most famous characters and familiar speeches in a new story. But at 100 hours with multiple unwieldy storylines, it was decided by writers Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor to abridge it – as a public service – to a brief and palatable 90-minute performance. Vanessa Jensen is directing William Shakespeare's Long Lost First Play (abridged), a fast, funny and fictional 40th play by the Bard that weaves together his popular speeches and plot devices. The main challenge, according to Vanessa, is reassuring non-Shakespeare fans that they don’t need to know or like his work to enjoy the show. “We also don’t want to offend true Shakespeare aficionados with the way the great Bard’s work is twisted and turned inside out for the sake of humour,” she said. First appearing on stage as an eight-year-old and directing her first show at 14, Vanessa has a wealth of theatre experience behind her. She wrote, directed, stage-managed and acted in various shows at Curtin University’s Hayman Theatre over a four-year period and has staged a plethora of successful productions at the Old Mill and Melville Theatres. Vanessa has plenty of best director and best play awards and nominations to her credit for shows including Away, Jamie’s Chooks, Twelve Angry Men, Mr Bailey’s Minder, Amadeus, Rabbit Hole and Love, Loss and What I Wore.
